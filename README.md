# Sanitizer-Controlled-Door
I have made a touchless faucet with door control system. COVID-19 is a serious pandemic at this moment. The coronavirus is spreading quickly and easily between humans. There are ways to curb the spread of this virus and one way is to wash hands using soap for at least 20 seconds. Sometimes, if the person carelessly touches the faucet - which could be contaminated - after washing his/ her hands, he/she has a higher chance of contracting this coronavirus disease. If you go out, it is safe to wash your hands before entering your premises. You do not have to touch the door handle because the door lock system is automated. In my project, a person will only be granted access once he/ she washes his/ her hands.
